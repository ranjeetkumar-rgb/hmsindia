# Complete Hub-Spoke Center Management System

## 🎯 **Overview**

This is a complete, database-driven hub-spoke center management system that integrates seamlessly with your existing center module. It provides a full CRUD interface for managing hub-spoke relationships and automatically applies the business logic to your billing system.

## 🏗️ **System Architecture**

### **Database Tables**
- `hms_hub_spoke_relationships` - Stores hub-spoke relationships
- `hms_centers` - Enhanced with `center_classification` field

### **Models**
- `Hub_spoke_model` - Manages all hub-spoke operations

### **Controllers**
- `Hub_spoke` - Full CRUD operations for relationships

### **Views**
- `hub_spoke/index.php` - Main listing page
- `hub_spoke/add.php` - Add new relationships
- `hub_spoke/edit.php` - Edit existing relationships
- `hub_spoke/view.php` - View relationship details

## 🚀 **Quick Start**

### **Step 1: Database Setup**
Run the SQL file to create the required table:

```bash
# Import the SQL file
mysql -u your_username -p your_database < hub_spoke_centers.sql
```

### **Step 2: Access the System**
Navigate to: `your-domain.com/hub_spoke`

### **Step 3: Add Your First Relationship**
1. Click "Add New Relationship"
2. Select a hub center (e.g., Delhi)
3. Select a spoke center (e.g., Rohini)
4. Save the relationship

## 📊 **How It Works**

### **Business Rules Implementation**
1. **Hub Centers**: Display same name for both "From" and "At" in billing
2. **Spoke Centers**: Display spoke name for "From" and hub name for "At" in billing

### **Example Scenarios**
- **Delhi (Hub)**: From = Delhi, At = Delhi
- **Rohini (Spoke → Delhi)**: From = Rohini, At = Delhi
- **Noida (Spoke → Ghaziabad)**: From = Noida, At = Ghaziabad

### **Automatic Classification**
- When you create a relationship, the system automatically:
  - Sets the hub center's classification to "hub"
  - Sets the spoke center's classification to "spoke"
  - Updates the billing display logic

## 🎨 **User Interface**

### **Main Dashboard**
- Clean table showing all relationships
- Quick action buttons for each relationship
- System information and business logic explanation
- Quick links to related modules

### **Add/Edit Forms**
- Dropdown selection for centers
- Form validation
- Auto-generated relationship names
- Clear explanations of how the system works

### **Integration Points**
- Added "Hub-Spoke Management" button to centers module
- Seamless navigation between modules
