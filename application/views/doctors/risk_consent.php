                                   In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) has become an established treatment for many forms of infertility.  The main goal of IVF is to allow a patient the opportunity to become pregnant using her own eggs or donor eggs and sperm from her partner or from a donor. This is an elective procedure designed to result in the patient’s pregnancy when other treatments have failed or are not appropriate.

A small needle will be passed directly into the ovary containing follicles via an ultrasound-guided vaginal puncture. This technique is performed on an inpatient day care basis under short general anesthesia in operation theatre. Throughout the procedure your heart, bloodpressure, and blood oxygenation will be constantly monitored by pulse oxymeter and an EKG machine. At all times an anesthetist will be in attendance. If the ovaries cannot be adequately visualized for ovum recovery by this method, then laparoscopic technique will be offered. This technique utilizes general anesthesia. The eggs can then be aspirated and transported to our laboratory.

Certain circumstances may exist to predict that your eggs/sperm are unlikely to fertilize using this conventional technique. In these cases, a procedure called intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) will be used. ICSI differs from insemination in that instead of combining sperm and eggs together and allowing fertilization to occur spontaneously, sperms are individually injected into each egg using a needle. This technique greatly increases the chances that the eggs will fertilize and can help overcome any fertilization problem. We (I) understand that there are associated risks with ICSI and any of the following may occur which would prevent ICSI from being performed, or prevent the establishment of pregnancy:

If pregnancy is successfully established, miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy, heterotopic pregnancy, stillbirth, multiple births, and/or congenital abnormalities (birth defects) may occur that are unrelated to this procedure, at the same rate as if unassisted fertilization (conventional insemination for IVF) had occurred. In situations where the male factor is the result of a genetic defect, the ICSI procedure may permit fertilization to occur normally, but the genetic defect may be passed on to resulting offspring. There is insufficient information at this time as to whether the occurrence of these are increased or decreased by this procedure.

                                  8. After several cell divisions when it is deemed that the embryo is developing normally, the embryo(s) will be transferred into the uterus by means of a small catheter inserted through your cervix two to five days following retrieval. In certain situations the zona pellucida (the eggshell surrounding the embryo) is abnormally thick and/or hardened and embryos are not able to break out of the zona pellucida spontaneously. This condition, which may compromise the ability of the embryo to implant in the uterine wall, is improved with a procedure called assisted hatching. Assisted hatching involves making a small hole in the zona pellucida using micromanipulation techniques.  This procedure (which must be performed on day 3 following egg retrieval ) may make it easier for the embryo(s) to emerge from their zona pellucida giving them an improved chance for implantation. Criteria for performing assisted hatching include appearance of the embryo and the zona pellucida. A thickened zona pellucida is commonly seen with advanced maternal age. Literature suggests that the procedure may benefit older women, those with elevated day 3 FSH levels, and in patients with prior unsuccessful IVF treatments. There are risks associated with this technique.

                                 Embryo transfer may occur five days following egg retrieval which is referred to as a blastocyst culture. Blastocyst culture involves placing embryos into culture in the laboratory for an additional two days to observe their continued development prior to transfer or freezing.  The literature indicates that this technique may be useful in selecting the most viable embryos, enabling the transfer of fewer embryos with a corresponding reduction in the risk of multiple pregnancies, and maintaining the same pregnancy rate as a day 3 transfer. In some cases, one or more of the embryos may stop growing prior to reaching the blastocyst stage. This may result in fewer embryos for transfer and, in some cases, no embryo transfer at all. We (I) acknowledge that we (I) have discussed the possibility of the need for these procedures with our (my) physician and understand and agree that

                                The pre-selected embryos and a small amount of fluid that the embryos have been cultured in will be introduced through the catheter to help achieve a possible pregnancy. This may cause minor cramping and possible (but rare) complications including bleeding and infection. The transfer of several embryos can result in multiple pregnancy (twins, triplets, or more), with an increased risk of miscarriage, premature labor, and premature birth. A premature delivery may jeopardize the life and long term health of a child and may result in substantial costs both financially and emotionally. Pregnancies with more than one baby in the uterus may also increase the occurrence of pregnancy-related medical complications for the mother such as high blood pressure and diabetes. Multiple pregnancies also increase the likelihood that a cesarean section will be required.

Early reports suggested a possible association between birth defects and the use of synthetic progesterone. The progesterone that we utilize is naturally occurring (not synthetic) and is similar to that which is normally produced by the ovary. There is no evidence of an increased risk of birth defects from this form of progesterone. Baby aspirin, antibiotics, and steroids are used as well.

These embryos may be thawed and transferred back into my uterus at a future time. We (I) understand that the potential benefit of cryopreservation is the possibility of establishing a pregnancy without going through an additional egg retrieval procedure. Cryopreservation of embryos has been used for many years with no evidence of adverse effects. Although there is less experience with human embryos, there is no evidence of adverse effects in children born as a result of transfer of frozen embryos. It is anticipated that about two-thirds frozen embryos will survive the thaw process. We understand that equipment failure or other unforeseen circumstances may arise which could have a negative impact on the survival of the embryos while they are still in cold storage. If the embryo(s) doesn’t appear viable after thawing, it will not be transferred.

                               Ovarian cysts commonly occur and cause pain and discomfort in the lower abdomen. Rarely, overstimulation or hyperstimulation may cause abdominal swelling and fluid retention leading to hospitalization and in extreme cases can cause cardiovascular collapse (shock and even death). The risks of these complications are extremely rare. Several days prior to and after the collection of eggs, one typically will have lower abdominal pressure and physical activity must be reduced, since these cysts may rupture and cause problems requiring surgery. The use of fertility drugs typically results in the placement of multiple embryos into the uterus. As discussed above, this can result in multiple pregnancy (twins, triplets, or more), with an increased risk of miscarriage, premature labor, and premature birth. The long-term effect of fertility drugs and its association with ovarian cancer is unknown. Presently, there are no studies that clearly illustrate an association between fertility drugs and ovarian cancer.

During my oocyte retrieval there is a possibility of damage to abdominal organs including bowel, bladder, blood vessels, uterus, fallopian tubes, cervix, and possible formation of scar tissue by my attempted ovum retrieval. This could result in a remote possibility of an open surgical procedure, blood transfusion, or antibiotic therapy to correct any injury incurred. To minimize any risk of infection antibiotics are utilized to minimize this risk.This may result in an allergic reaction, which may present as a rash. In its most severe form, an allergic reaction may be life threatening. The utilization of tetracycline/doxycycline is associated with an increased sensitivity to the sun, and therefore caution should be taken to avoid prolonged sun exposure. The utilization of antibiotics may also be associated with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, loss of appetite and vaginal yeast infections.

Infertility and its treatment can affect a patient and her spouse or partner medically, financially, socially, emotionally and psychologically. Feelings of anxiety, depression, isolation, and helplessness are not uncommon among patients undergoing infertility treatment. Strained and stressful relations with spouses, partners and other loved ones are not uncommon as treatment gets underway and progresses. Psychosocial effects of infertility treatment may include:

                            Infertility treatment can raise concerns and questions of an ethical or religious nature for some patients. The technique of in vitro fertilization (IVF) involves the creation of human embryos outside the body, and can involve the production of excess embryos and/or “high-order” multiple pregnancy (triplets or more).  Using of donor or surrogates also poses such ethical dilemmas.Patients and their spouses or partners who so desire are encouraged to consult with trusted members of their religious community for guidance on their infertility treatment.

                            There are several alternatives to IVF treatment. Using donor sperm, donor eggs, donor embryo adoption, surrogacy or not pursuing treatment are also options. Adoption by government laws is also an option.Gametes (sperm and/or eggs), instead of embryos may be frozen for future attempts at pregnancy in an effort to avoid potential future legal or ethical issues relating to disposition of any cryopreserved embryos.

Consequently, data from my/our IVF procedure will be provided to the Indian government PCPNDT office. The office may request additional information from the treatment center or contact me/us directly for additional follow-up. Additionally, my/our information may be used and disclosed in order to perform research, data aggregation and/or quality control. All information used for research will be de-identified prior to publication. De-identification is a process intended to prevent the data associated with my/our treatment being used to identify me/us as individuals.
